## What is Lomi?

Lomi is a local development workspace for macOS, Linux and Windows. Open a
project folder and arrange real shells, editors, browser previews, Git views and
AI chats side by side. Keep separate workspaces for separate tasks; their
terminals keep running in the background while you switch.

Run Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI or any other CLI agent in a Lomi terminal,
and let it work with your workspace over MCP once you approve it. Lomi is built
with Tauri 2 and Rust and uses the system webview. There is no account and no
telemetry: API keys stay in your system credential store, and history stays on
your device.
